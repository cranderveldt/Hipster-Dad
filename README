Hipster Dad is a project I started in order to learn more about JavaScript and jQuery. Every object in this game is pulled from the attributes of HTML elements, and styled in CSS. The story of the game follows Bison, a hipster-turned-father who never really learned how to live in the real world. Eventually this game will be a full sandbox- and exploration-type game, where you can go to a number of places in the town. Enjoy!
